<p>Man of the Book, thou Pilgrim of the Road,<br />
&nbsp;  The love of travel<br />
Drave thee on ever with pursuing goad;<br />
Trust was thy burning light, Truth was thy load&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;  Sweet riddles for the weary to unravel,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within thy breast<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Glowed the pure fire of an Eternal Quest.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>The Bible was thy chart, the open sky<br />
&nbsp;  Thy roof and rafter<br />
Often, and thou didst learn night&rsquo;s mystery;<br />
Learning some tale from each poor passer-by,<br />
&nbsp;  Some gracious secret for the grand Hereafter.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Master of lore<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Occult, and wanderer on the wildest shore.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>What country was not trodden by thy feet,<br />
&nbsp;  Nor bared its bosom<br />
And fragrance to the life it leapt to greet?<br />
From field and upland or where waters meet<br />
&nbsp;  Was stolen, the virgin dew, the veil&egrave;d blossom.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its native tongue<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On stranger lips, in every climate hung.</p>

<p>Pursuer of shy paths, all hunted things<br />
&nbsp;  All creatures lonely,<br />
Gypsy and fox and hawk with slanted wings;<br />
These drank with thee at the same cosmic springs,<br />
&nbsp;  These were thy teachers and thy playmates only.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nature gave up<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To them and thee alike, her hidden cup.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Divine and strong<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stood out the altar, with its flame of song.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6</p>
<p>Thy bardlike power, the passion of thy thirst<br />
&nbsp;  For something greater,<br />
Awoke old Cymric melodies the first;<br />
Till all the mountains into music burst,<br />
&nbsp;  And their lost glory crowned the recreator.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Outpoured as wine<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy magic words made every shade a shrine.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Priest of the portals into the Unknown,<br />

<p>9</p>
<p>Thou gypsy of all time, no lot seems strange,<br />
&nbsp;  No life was sterile<br />
To that free spirit, wrought by rugged change;<br />
Thy heart found rest in strife, and did outrange<br />
&nbsp;  The farthest fancy, and woo the sorest peril.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hardships and lack<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were comrades, and the milestones on thy track.</p>

7</span>GEORGE HENRY BORROW.</h2>
<p>The time is ripe, and over ripe, for a commemorative celebration of 
George Borrow in a city with which he was so long, and so intimately, 
associated as he was with Norwich.&nbsp; His increasing fame as a foremost 
literary man of the nineteenth century is amply witnessed to by the various
biographies of him, and the numerous appreciations of him by writers of 
repute, and Mr. Clement Shorter&rsquo;s forthcoming &ldquo;Life of 
Borrow&rdquo; will certainly add to the cult.</p>
<p>The following sketch of this wayward genius is mainly devoted to 
outstanding characteristics, with necessarily brief accounts of his works 
and journeyings.&nbsp; It seems convenient to sum up his career in the four
divisions which follow.</p>
<h3><i>Section I</i>.<br />
(1803-15)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Early Wandering Days.</span></h3>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s father, Thomas Borrow, was a patriotic, pugnacious, but 
God-fearing Cornishman, born at an old homestead known as Trethinnick, in 
the parish of St. Cleer, in which his forbears had been settled well back 
in the seventeenth century, probably earlier.&nbsp; To quote Dr. Knapp: 
&ldquo;They feared God, honoured the king, and believed in 
&lsquo;piskies&rsquo; and Holy Wells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Borrow, handsome, tall, and muscular, was an adept in the 
athletic sports for which Cornwall is famous, and early signalised himself 
by his prowess as a boxer.&nbsp; As he grew up, George Borrow himself 
became an ardent admirer of &ldquo;the Fancy,&rdquo; and when asked 
&ldquo;What is the best way to get through life quietly?&rdquo; was wont to
say, &ldquo;Learn to box, and keep a civil tongue in your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1778, when nineteen years of age, Thomas Borrow was articled for five
years to a maltster; but just as that period expired, at Menheniot Fair a 
bicker arose in which Borrow and other young heroes triumphed over the 
braves of that town.&nbsp; Constables appeared, <!-- page 8--><a 
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>but were promptly felled 
by the brawny Borrow, and, to crown his misdeeds, he knocked over the 
head-borough, who happened to be his maltster master.&nbsp; He wisely fled,
and shortly after enlisted as a private soldier in the Coldstream Guards, 
and was soon quartered in London.&nbsp; In 1792, as a sergeant, he was 
transferred to the West Norfolk Regiment of Militia, with headquarters at 
East Dereham.&nbsp; A company of players from Norwich frequently visited 
that nice little town, and in one of them appeared, as a supernumerary, Ann
Perfrement, the pretty daughter of a small farmer of Dumpling Green, on the
outskirts of the town.&nbsp; This maiden, of Huguenot descent, fascinated 
the Cornish soldier, and the two were married at Dereham Church on February
11th, 1793.&nbsp; The regiment was then about to start a wandering course 
over the highways of England&mdash;at Colchester; in Norfolk; then at 
Sheerness, Sandgate, and Dover; at Colchester once more; in Kent; Essex 
again, and then, in 1802-3, at East Dereham, where George was born July 
5th, 1803, in the house of his maternal grandparents.&nbsp; On July 17th he
was baptized <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
9</span>George Henry, names of the king and of the eldest brother of 
Captain Thomas Borrow.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

Murray" src="images/p8as.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>As a mere infant Borrow was gloomy and fond of solitude, &ldquo;ever 
conscious,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;of a peculiar heaviness within me, and at
times of a strange sensation of fear, which occasionally amounted to 
horror, and for which I could assign no real cause whatever.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Of this earliest period he tells a characteristic story of drawing strange 
lines in the dust with his fingers, when a Jew pedlar came up and said: 
&ldquo;The child is a sweet child, and he has all the look of one of our 
own people&rdquo;; but when he leaned forward to inspect the lines in the 
dust, &ldquo;started back, and grew white as a sheet; then, taking off his 
hat, he made some strange gestures to me, cringing, chattering, . . . and 
shortly departed, muttering something about &lsquo;holy letters,&rsquo; and
talking to himself in a strange tongue.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, in the first 
chapter of &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; is in the true Borrovian mystery-man 
style.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p8bb.jpg">
<img alt="George Borrow&rsquo;s birthplace, Dumpling Green, East Dereham" 
src="images/p8bs.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Again and again Borrow, throughout his life, suffered from some nervous 
ailment which defied definition; thus, when he was fifteen, his strength 
and appetite deserted him and he pined and drooped, but an ancient female, 
a kind of doctress, who had been his nurse in his infancy, gave him a 
decoction of a bitter root growing on commons and desolate places, from 
which he took draughts till he was convalescent.&nbsp; In any estimate of 
Borrow&rsquo;s life the strange attacks of what he called &ldquo;the 
Fear&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Horrors&rdquo; must be taken into account.&nbsp; 
At times they even produced a suicidal tendency, as when, in 1824, he wrote
to his friend Roger Kerrison, &ldquo;Come to me immediately; I am, I 
believe, dying.&rdquo;&nbsp; The facsimile of this note in Knapp&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Life of Borrow&rdquo; is as tremulous as if the writer was suffering
from delirium tremens, which, of course, he was not.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p8cb.jpg">
<img alt="Roger Kerrison" src="images/p8cs.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>We have in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; a very interesting account of the boy 
Borrow being taken twice every Sunday to the fine parish church at East 
Dereham, where, from a corner of a spacious pew, he would fix his eyes on 
the dignified high-Church rector and the dignified high-Church clerk, 
&ldquo;from whose lips would roll many a portentous word descriptive of the
wondrous works of the Most High.&rdquo;&nbsp; The rector was the Rev. F. J.
H. Wollaston, B.D., who was himself patron of <!-- page 10--><a 
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>the living, which 
reverted to the Crown in 1841.&nbsp; At East Dereham, too, he came in touch
with that exquisite old gentlewoman, Lady Fenn, widow of Sir John Fenn, 
editor of the &ldquo;Paston Letters,&rdquo; as she passed to and fro from 
her mansion on some errand of bounty or of mercy, leaning on her 
gold-headed cane, whilst the sleek old footman walked at a respectful 
distance behind.&nbsp; But Borrow&rsquo;s admiration for Philo, the clerk, 
was greatest&mdash;&ldquo;Peace to thee, thou fine old chap, despiser of 
dissenters, and hater of papists, as became a dignified and high-Church 
clerk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Dereham in April, 1810, Captain Borrow and his family were 
transferred to Norman Cross, in the parish of Yaxley, some four miles from 
Peterborough, to guard a large number of French prisoners in sixteen long 
casernes, or barracks.&nbsp; At this place little Borrow, now seven years 
old, made a friend, quite to his liking, in a wild sequestered spot which 
was his favourite haunt; for he was allowed to pass his time principally in
wandering about the neighbouring country.&nbsp; It was at this wild nook he
came to know a viper-catcher and herbalist, a quaint figure in a skin cap, 
and with stout gaiters, who was catching a viper when the boy first made 
his acquaintance.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;What do you think of catching such a 
thing as that with the naked hand?&rsquo; asked the old fellow.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;What do I think?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, that I could do as
much myself.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; This ruffled the old man&rsquo;s pride, 
but later he became quite friendly and explained that he hunted the vipers 
for their fat, to make unguents especially for rheumatism, and also 
collected simples, knowing he virtues of such as had medicinal value.&nbsp;
On one of his excursions this primitive sportsman told him the marvellous 
tale of the King of the Vipers.&nbsp; The old fellow was wakened from his 
sleep one sultry day by a dreadful viper moving towards 
him&mdash;&ldquo;all yellow and gold . . . bearing its head about a foot 
and a-half above the ground, the dry stubble crackling beneath its 
outrageous belly . . . then it lifted its head and chest high in the air, 
and high over my face as I looked up, flickering at me with its tongue as 
if it would fly at my face.&nbsp; Child,&rdquo; continued the narrator, 
&ldquo;what I felt at that moment I can scarcely say, but it was a 
sufficient punishment for all the sins I ever committed; and there we two 
were, I looking up at the viper, <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>and the viper looking down upon me, flickering 
at me with its tongue.&rdquo;&nbsp; Happily a sharp gun report close at 
hand frightened the reptile away.&nbsp; Before leaving the neighbourhood 
the viper-catcher presented his child friend with a specimen which he had 
tamed and rendered harmless by removing the fangs.&nbsp; This creature the 
queer boy fed with milk and often carried with him in his walks.</p>
<p>This episode resulted in experiences which coloured all the rest of 
Borrow&rsquo;s life, for, soon after, when he first came among gypsy tents,
and saw the long-haired woman with skin dark and swarthy like that of a 
toad, and a particularly evil expression, and when her husband threatened 
to baste the intruder with a ladle, the boy broke forth into what in Romany
would be called a &ldquo;gillie,&rdquo; or ditty, ending&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My father lies concealed within my tepid breast,<br />
And if to me you offer any harm or wrong,<br />
I&rsquo;ll call him forth to help me with his forked tongue.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story cannot be mangled without losing its wild significance, but, 
on further threats, Borrow, to use his own words, &ldquo;made a motion 
which the viper understood; and now partly disengaging itself from my 
bosom, where it had lain perdu, it raised its head to a level with my face,
and stared upon my enemy with its glittering eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The superstitious gypsies were effectively terrified, and invited the 
lad into their tent: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, and say no; but look 
kindly upon us, and satisfied, my precious little God Almighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had taken him for a goblin, but when he explained that he was not 
&ldquo;one of them there,&rdquo; the man said, &ldquo;You are a sap-engro, 
a chap who catches snakes, and plays tricks with them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, 
when the boy proceeded to read them a bit of &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe,&rdquo;
it was voted that it &ldquo;beat the rubricals hollow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Next 
followed the momentous meeting with Ambrose Smith&mdash;the Jasper 
Petulengro of Borrow&rsquo;s pages&mdash;and, as the band of gypsies were 
departing, Jasper, turning round, leered into the little Gorgio&rsquo;s 
face, held out his hand, and said, &ldquo;Goodbye, Sap, I daresay we shall 
meet again; remember we are brothers, two gentle brothers.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Gazing after the retreating company, the sap-engro said to himself, 
&ldquo;A strange set of people, I <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>wonder who they can be.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was 
Borrow&rsquo;s first introduction to the Romany folk.</p>
<p>From July, 1811, to July, 1814, the Borrows led a nomadic life, yet at 
each tarrying-place Captain Borrow sent his sons to the best school 
available, and George, in these three years&rsquo; travelling with the 
regiment, acquired Lilly&rsquo;s Latin Grammar by heart.&nbsp; A Dereham 
schoolmaster had assured Captain Borrow that &ldquo;there is but one good 
school book in the world&mdash;the one I use in my 
seminary&mdash;Lilly&rsquo;s Latin Grammar.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is, it may 
be added, good evidence that Shakespeare was taught out of this venerable 
work.</p>
<p>Early in 1813 our interesting family were in Edinburgh, where the Borrow
boys were sent to the celebrated High School, and George entered with zest 
into the faction fights between the Auld and the New Toon.&nbsp; More, and 
better than this, he picked up just such a wild character as fitted in with
his romantic scheme of things.&nbsp; This was David Haggart, son of a 
gamekeeper and guilty of nearly every crime in the Statute Book under 
various aliases&mdash;John Wilson, John Morrison, John McColgan, David 
O&rsquo;Brien, and &ldquo;The Switcher.&rdquo;&nbsp; Haggart enlisted as a 
drummer-boy in Captain Borrow&rsquo;s recruiting-party at Leith Races in 
July, 1813, being then just twelve years old; but soon tiring of discipline
and scanty pay, obtained his discharge, soon after embarking on a career of
crime which culminated in his well-deserved hanging at Edinburgh in 1821, 
at the age of twenty.</p>

Tuck
</p>
<p>In June, 1814, the West Norfolk Regiment was ordered south; some went by
sea, those who preferred by land.&nbsp; Captain Borrow chose the latter, 
and on July 18th his division entered Norwich, and the Earl of Orford, 
colonel of the regiment, entertained the officers and their friends at the 
Maid&rsquo;s Head Hotel.&nbsp; At this time Captain Borrow and his family 
went to lodge at the Crown and Angel, an ancient hostelry in St. 
Stephen&rsquo;s Street.&nbsp; From that convenient centre, the 
recruiting-parties under Captain Borrow were very successful in obtaining 
men, by beat of drum instead of by ballot, as had previously been the 
practice.&nbsp; But troubles arose in Ireland, and in August, 1815, the 
West Norfolks were again on the move.&nbsp; They found themselves at Cork 
early in September, and marched on to Clonmel.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
13</span>During their short interval at Norwich, George went to the Grammar
School, and his brother studied painting with &ldquo;Old Crome.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p12bb.jpg">
<img alt="The Grammar School" src="images/p12bs.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Captain Borrow commanded a division, and George walked by his side, 
holding the stirrup-leather of his horse, while John Thomas Borrow, 
gazetted ensign in May and lieutenant in December, was in his place in the 
regiment.&nbsp; At Clonmel the Borrows lodged with a handsome athletic man 
and his wife, who enthusiastically welcomed them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have made 
bold to bring up a bottle of claret,&rdquo; said the Orangeman, &ldquo;. . 
. and when your honour and your family have dined, I will make bold too to 
bring up Mistress Hyne from Londonderry, to introduce to your 
honour&rsquo;s lady, and then we&rsquo;ll drink to the health of King 
George, God bless him; to the &lsquo;glorious and immortal&rsquo;&mdash;to 
Boyne water&mdash;to your honour&rsquo;s speedy promotion to be 
Lord-Lieutenant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here at Clonmel our hero &ldquo;read the Latin tongue and the Greek 
letters with a nice old clergyman, who sat behind a black oaken desk, with 
a huge Elzevir Flaccus before him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says 
Borrow, &ldquo;I was in the habit of sitting on a large stone, before the 
roaring fire in the huge open chimney, and entertaining certain of the 
Protestant young gentlemen of my own age . . . with extraordinary accounts 
of my own adventures and those of the corps, with an occasional anecdote 
extracted from the story-books of Hickathrift and Wight Wallace, pretending
to be conning the lesson all the while.&rdquo;&nbsp; Borrow calls 
Hickathrift his countryman; the legend is that Tom Hickathrift ridded the 
Fenland between Lynn and Wisbech, of a monstrous giant, by slaying him with
the axle-tree of his cart.&nbsp; I gave the full story of this Norfolk 
giant-killer in the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, for January, 
1896.&nbsp; The boy&rsquo;s genius for story telling was quite exceptional,
and when he was at Norwich Grammar School, as his schoolfellow Dr. 
Martineau informed me, &ldquo;He used to gather about him three or four 
favourite schoolfellows, after they had learned their class lesson and 
before the class was called up, and with a sheet of paper and book on his 
knee, invent and tell a story, making rapid little pictures of each 
<i>Dramatis </i><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 14</span><i>Persona</i>.&nbsp; The plot was woven and 
spread out with much ingenuity, and the characters were various and 
well-discriminated.&nbsp; But two of them were sure to turn up in every 
tale, the Devil and the Pope: and the working of the drama invariably had 
the same issue&mdash;the utter ruin and disgrace of these two 
Potentates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Clonmel it was his good luck to make friends with one more notable 
character, another figure in his gallery of strange 
personages&mdash;Murtagh, a Papist gasoon, sent to school by his father to 
be &ldquo;made a saggrart of and sent to Paris and Salamanca.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
But the gasoon loved cards better.&nbsp; George had a new pack, which soon 
changed hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t learn Greek, so you must teach 
Irish!&rdquo; said George.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before Christmas, Murtagh was 
playing at cards with his brother Denis, and I could speak a considerable 
quantity of broken Irish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In January, 1816, the regiment was moved on to Templemore, a charming 
town in mid-Tipperary, where the Borrows remained but a short time, 
reaching Norwich again on May 13th, and tarrying at the Crown and Angel 
till they settled at the historic little house in King&rsquo;s Court, 
Willow Lane, which they leased from a builder named Thomas King.&nbsp; At 
the instance of Sir Peter Eade, it was re-named Borrow&rsquo;s Court, and 
the tablet commemorating the residence there of George Borrow was affixed 
on November 6th, 1891.&nbsp; Now, by the generosity of the Lord Mayor of 
Norwich (Arthur Michael Samuel), in this year of grace 1913, it has become 
a possession of the City of Norwich as a Borrow Museum in perpetuity.</p>
<p>At Templemore George Borrow, tall and large-limbed for a lad of 
thirteen, still had adventures; for on an excursion to visit his brother at
Loughmore, he encountered the fierce &ldquo;Dog of Peace&rdquo; and its 
master, Jerry Grant, the outlaw&mdash;&ldquo;a fairy man, in league with 
fairies and spirits, and able to work much harm by supernatural means, on 
which account the peasants held him in great awe.&rdquo;&nbsp; The account 
of Sergeant Bagge&rsquo;s encounter with this wizardly creature is in 
Borrow&rsquo;s best style.&nbsp; The sergeant thought he had the fellow 
fast by the throat, but suddenly &ldquo;the man seemed to melt away from 
his grasp, and the wind howled more and more, and the night poured <!-- 
page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>down 
darker and darker, the snow and the sleet thicker and more blinding.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Lord have mercy upon us!&rsquo; said Bagge, who concluded that the 
tussle was &lsquo;not fair but something Irish and 
supernatural.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; comments George 
to his brother, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; I have read of witchcraft in
the Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Templemore, too, our boy of thirteen learned to ride, mounted on a 
tremendous &ldquo;gallant specimen of the genuine Irish cob,&rdquo; said by
Borrow to be nearly extinct in his day.&nbsp; This horse had been the only 
friend in the world of his groom, but after a blow would not let him 
mount.&nbsp; So young Borrow mounted the animal barebacked, for, said the 
groom, &ldquo;If you are ever to be a frank rider, you must begin without a
saddle; . . . leave it all to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Following the groom&rsquo;s
directions, the cob gave his young rider every assistance, and great was 
the lad&rsquo;s joy!&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, that ride! that first 
ride!&mdash;most truly it was an epoch in my existence; and I still look 
back to it with feelings of longing and regret.&nbsp; People may talk of 
first love&mdash;it is a very agreeable event, I daresay&mdash;but give me 
the flush and triumph, and glorious sweat of a first ride, like mine on the
mighty cob! . . . By that one trial I had become free . . . of the whole 
equine species.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus began Borrow&rsquo;s passion for the 
equine race, and he avows that with him the pursuit of languages was always
modified by his love of horses.&nbsp; As a wonderful pendant to this riding
exploit, Borrow tells the tale of the Irish smith who, by a magical word, 
which thrilled the boy, absolutely maddened the cob, until the wizard 
soothed it by uttering another word &ldquo;in a voice singularly modified, 
but sweet and almost plaintive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this weird episode ends the tale, as &ldquo;coloured up and 
poetized&rdquo; in &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; of Borrow&rsquo;s earliest 
journeyings and adventures; truly in his case adventures were to the 
adventurous.&nbsp; Having had all the wild experiences just outlined, small
wonder that the strange lad was not very adaptable when, as a free scholar,
he came under the rule of the Rev. Edward Valpy at Norwich Grammar 
School.</p>

<p>The criss-cross experiences of his boyhood, together with his mixed 
Cornish and Gallic heredity, were elements that very largely helped to 
create the whimsical character of George Borrow.&nbsp; We have now come to 
the time when the old soldier, with his pension of eight shillings a day, 
and his excellent and devoted wife, settled with their two sons at the 
little house in Willow Lane, Norwich.</p>

</a></p>
<p>For a short time in 1814, when his parents lodged in St. 
Stephen&rsquo;s, young George was sent to the Grammar School; but now, in 
1816, settled comfortably in Norwich, he was again sent to the Grammar 
School, under the Rev. Edward Valpy, called by Dr. Knapp &ldquo;a severe 
master,&rdquo; by Mr. Walling &ldquo;a martinet,&rdquo; whose 
&ldquo;principal claims to fame,&rdquo; says Mr. Jenkins, &ldquo;are his 
severity, his having flogged the conqueror of the &lsquo;Flaming 
Tinman,&rsquo; and his destruction of the School Records of Admission, 
which dated back to the sixteenth century.&rdquo;&nbsp; Against this chorus
of denunciation, I will quote from a letter the late Dr. Martineau wrote me
about Borrow: &ldquo;It is true that I had to <i>hoist</i> (not 
&lsquo;horse&rsquo;) Borrow for his flogging; but not that there was 
anything exceptional, or capable of leaving permanent scars in the 
infliction: Mr. Valpy was not given to excess of that kind.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is a pity that the earliest biographers did not get the opinion of some of 
Borrow&rsquo;s surviving schoolfellows as to their old master.&nbsp; Dr. 
Knapp, in 1899, stated that Dr. Martineau (died January 11th, 1900), and 
Dr. W. E. Image, D.L., J.P., of Herringswell House, Suffolk (died September
26th, 1903), were the only survivors of Borrow&rsquo;s schoolmates.&nbsp; 
Amongst these was Thomas Borrow Burcham, the London Police Magistrate, who,
there is good reason <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>to believe, was a cousin of George&rsquo;s, as 
his father married a Mary Perfrement, and T. B. Burcham was christened at 
East Dereham Church.</p>

</a></p>
<p>It is quite noteworthy that Borrow makes no mention of his term at the 
Grammar School in &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; but, after his Irish experiences,
opens a chapter with the following eloquent description of 
Norwich:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A fine old city, truly, is that, view it from whatever side you 
will, but it shows best from the east, where the ground, bold and elevated,
overlooks the fair and fertile valley in which it stands.&nbsp; Gazing from
those heights, the eye beholds a scene which cannot fail to awaken, even in
the least sensitive bosom, feelings of pleasure and admiration.&nbsp; At 
the foot of the heights flows a narrow and deep river, with an antique 
bridge communicating with a long and narrow suburb, flanked on either side 
by rich meadows of the brightest green, beyond which spreads the city, the 
fine old city, perhaps the most curious specimen at present extant of the 
genuine old English town.&nbsp; Yes, there it spreads from north to south, 
with its venerable houses, its numerous gardens, its thrice twelve 
churches, its mighty mound, which, if tradition speaks true, was raised by 
human hands to serve as the grave heap of an old heathen king, who sits 
deep within it, with his sword in his hand and his gold and silver 
treasures about him.&nbsp; There is a grey old castle upon the top of that 
mighty mound; and yonder, rising three hundred feet above the soil, from 
among those noble forest trees, behold that old Norman master-work, that 
cloud encircled cathedral spire, around which a garrulous army of rooks and
choughs continually wheel their flight.&nbsp; Now, who can wonder that the 
children of that fine old city are proud of her, and offer up prayers for 
her prosperity?&nbsp; I, myself, who was not born within her walls, offer 
up prayers for her prosperity, that want may never visit her 
cottages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was yonder, to the west, that the great naval hero of Britain 
first saw the light; he who annihilated the sea pride of Spain and dragged 
the humble banner of France in triumph at his stern.&nbsp; He was born 
yonder to the west, and of him there is a glorious relic in that old town; 
in its dark flint guildhouse, the roof of which you can <!-- page 18--><a 
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>just descry rising 
above that maze of buildings, in the upper hall of justice, is a species of
glass shrine, in which the relic is to be seen: a sword of curious 
workmanship, the blade is of keen Toledan steel, the heft of ivory and 
mother-of-pearl.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the sword of Cordova, won in the 
bloodiest fray off St. Vincent&rsquo;s promontory, and presented by Nelson 
to the old capital of the much-loved land of his birth.&nbsp; Yes, the 
proud Spaniard&rsquo;s sword is to be seen in yonder guildhouse, in the 
glass case affixed to the wall; many other relics has the good old town, 
but none prouder than the Spaniard&rsquo;s sword.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After these descriptive passages, he at once passes to the questionings 
of his father and mother as to the career of &ldquo;the other child,&rdquo;
much more difficult to settle in life than his more sober-minded elder 
brother, who had, as Dr. Martineau informed me, &ldquo;quite too much 
sense&rdquo; to join in the wild escapade described by Dr. Knapp in one of 
his most &ldquo;purple patches.&rdquo;&nbsp; Captain Borrow was sadly 
exercised about his younger son, and exclaimed, in the discussion about his
prospects, &ldquo;Why, he has neither my hair nor eyes; and then his 
countenance!&nbsp; Why, &rsquo;tis absolutely swarthy, God forgive 
me!&nbsp; I had almost said like that of a gypsy, but I have nothing to say
against that; the boy is not to be blamed for the colour of his face, nor 
for his hair and eyes; but, then, his ways and manners!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our glimpses of the Grammar School life are meagre, but we can readily 
understand that to a lad of Borrow&rsquo;s temperament the routine of a 
well-ordered school was naturally distasteful, though he loved to gain 
knowledge from any unconventional source open to him.&nbsp; So we find him 
studying French and Italian with &ldquo;one banished priest,&rdquo; the 
Rev. Thomas D&rsquo;Eterville, M.A., of Caen University, who, as Borrow 
says, &ldquo;lived in an old court of the old town,&rdquo; having come to 
Norwich in 1793.&nbsp; He advertised his &ldquo;school in St. 
Andrew&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and this was situated in Locket&rsquo;s Yard, now 
built over by Messrs. Harmer&rsquo;s factory.&nbsp; Later he resided in the
Strangers&rsquo; Hall, then occupied by priests of the adjoining Roman 
Catholic Chapel of St. John, now superseded by the grand church which 
towers on the crest of St. Giles&rsquo;s Hill.&nbsp; The Norman priest was 
<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
19</span>robust, with a slight stoop, but a rapid and vigorous step, 
&ldquo;sixty or thereabouts,&rdquo; when Borrow was his pupil in 1816, 
according to &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he was really considerably 
younger, for when he died at Caen, February 22nd, 1843, his age was given 
as seventy-six.&nbsp; In a local obituary notice he was described as 
&ldquo;a well-known and respected inhabitant of Norwich for upwards of 
forty years, who retired a few months ago to end his days in his native 
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; He made a small fortune, and there were rumours that 
he was engaged in the contraband trade.&nbsp; In a suppressed passage, 
reproduced by Dr. Knapp in his notes to &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; 
D&rsquo;Eterville says he found friends here, and was able to ride a good 
horse to visit pupils in the country; also that he always carried pistols, 
which Borrow said he had seen.&nbsp; Here, then, was another character 
after Borrow&rsquo;s heart, especially as he told his pupil that one day he
would be a great philologist.&nbsp; Of course, young Borrow was by no means
the sort of lad to spend all his time on books.&nbsp; He loved to sally 
forth with an old condemned musket, and did such execution that he seldom 
returned (sad to say!) without a string of bullfinches, blackbirds, and 
linnets hanging round his neck.&nbsp; Yet, as Mr. Jenkins says, 
Borrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;love of animals was almost feminine.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
With less zest he went fishing&mdash;too listless a pastime to interest him
much, for he often fell into a doze by the water side, and sometimes let 
his rod drop into the stream.&nbsp; His poetical but strictly accurate 
account of Earlham is worth quoting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At some distance from the city, behind a range of hilly ground 
which rises towards the south-west, is a small river, the waters of which, 
after many meanderings, eventually enter the principal river of the 
district, and assist to swell the tide which it rolls down to the 
ocean.&nbsp; It is a sweet rivulet, and pleasant it is to trace its course 
from its spring-head, high up in the remote regions of East Anglia, till it
arrives in the valley behind yon rising ground; and pleasant is that 
valley, truly a goodly spot, but most lovely where yonder bridge crosses 
the little stream.&nbsp; Beneath its arch the waters rush garrulously into 
a blue pool, and are there stilled for a time, for the pool is deep, and 
they appear to have sunk to sleep.&nbsp; Farther on, however, you <!-- page
20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>hear their 
voice again, where they ripple gaily over yon gravelly shallow.&nbsp; On 
the left, the hill slopes gently down to the margin of the stream.&nbsp; On
the right is a green level, a smiling meadow, grass of the richest decks 
the side of the slope; mighty trees also adorn it, giant elms, the nearest 
of which, when the sun is nigh at its meridian, fling a broad shadow upon 
the face of the pool; through yon vista you catch a glimpse of the ancient 
brick of an old English hall.&nbsp; It has a stately look, that old 
building, indistinctly seen, as it is, among those umbrageous trees; you 
might almost suppose it an earl&rsquo;s home; and such it was, or rather 
upon its site stood an earl&rsquo;s home, in the days of old, for there 
some old Kemp, some Sigurd, or Thorkild, roaming in quest of a hearthstead,
settled down in the gray old time, when Thor and Freya were yet gods, and 
Odin was a portentous name.&nbsp; Yon old hall is still called the 
Earl&rsquo;s Home.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was while fishing in &ldquo;a sweet rivulet&rdquo; in the grounds of 
the old hall one summer&rsquo;s day that &ldquo;a voice, clear and sonorous
as a bell,&rdquo; asked, &ldquo;Canst thou answer to thy conscience for 
pulling all those fish out of the water, and leaving them to gasp in the 
sun?&rdquo;&nbsp; The speaker was none other than the learned Friend, 
Joseph John Gurney (1788-1847), who as a young man read nearly all the Old 
Testament in Hebrew in the early morning.&nbsp; It was natural, therefore, 
that he should ask the young angler if he knew Hebrew, having confessed, 
according to &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; that he himself could not read 
Dante.&nbsp; This is clearly wrong, for writing to Thomas Fowell Buxton, in
1808, he mentions that he is reading Sophocles, some Italian, Livy, etc., 
and in the following year he informs his sister, Hannah Buxton, that he is 
engaged, <i>inter alia</i>, on Apollonius Rhodius, the Greek Testament, and
Ariosto.</p>

<p>Borrow had good reason to respect and admire the Quakers, as is 
evidenced in &ldquo;Wild Wales&rdquo; (Chap. CVI.), for when a Methodist 
called them &ldquo;a bad lot,&rdquo; and said he at first thought Borrow 
was a Methodist minister (!), and hoped to hear from him something 
&ldquo;conducive to salvation,&rdquo; Borrow&rsquo;s severe answer was: 
&ldquo;So you shall.&nbsp; Never speak ill of people of whom you know 
nothing.&nbsp; If that <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>isn&rsquo;t a saying conducive to salvation, I 
know not what is.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not very creditable, in my opinion, 
that the late Mr. J. B. Braithwaite, in his &ldquo;Memoirs of J. J. 
Gurney&rdquo; (two volumes, 1854), never once mentions Borrow by 
name.&nbsp; I have no doubt, however, that the following passage refers to 
him: &ldquo;&lsquo;Wilt thou execute a little commission for me at 
Arch&rsquo;s?&rsquo; said Joseph John Gurney, addressing another of his 
young friends, whom he had kindly taken one day to dine at his lodgings 
during the interval between the sittings of the Yearly Meeting.&nbsp; His 
young friend, of course, readily assented.&nbsp; J. J. Gurney wrote a few 
lines on a slip of paper which he handed to his young friend, enclosed to 
his bookseller&rsquo;s; but without giving to his young companion any 
intimation of its contents.&nbsp; The note was duly delivered, and the 
circumstance was forgotten until, after a lapse of a few weeks, the young 
friend, no less to his surprise than to his delight, received a large 
parcel, sent to him, as he was informed, at Joseph John Gurney&rsquo;s 
request, consisting of thirty volumes, comprising the Lexicons of Simonis 
and Schleusner, and the Scholia of the Rosenm&uuml;llers (the father and 
son) on the Old and New Testaments: a great prize indeed to a youthful 
student.&nbsp; Many were the instances in which he thus encouraged, amongst
his young friends, a taste for reading, more especially in those pursuits 
in which he himself delighted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Who can wonder at Mr. Clement Shorter&rsquo;s indignation when, in his 
address in Norwich on the Borrow Centenary in 1903, after enumerating many 
great Norwich people, he endeavoured to show &ldquo;that Borrow, the very 
least of those men and women in public estimation for a good portion of his
life, and perhaps the least in popular judgment ever since his death, was 
really the greatest, was really the man of all others, to whom this 
beautiful city should do honour if it asks for a name out of its 
nineteenth-century history to crown with local recognition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his Tombland Fair chapter is this vivid patch of local colour:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I was standing on the castle hill in the midst of a fair of 
horses.&nbsp; I have already had occasion to mention this castle.&nbsp; It 
is the remains of what was once a Norman stronghold, and is perched upon a 
round <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
22</span>mound or monicle, in the midst of the old city.&nbsp; Steep is 
this mound and scarped, evidently by the hand of man; a deep gorge, over 
which is flung a bridge, separates it, on the south, from a broad swell of 
open ground called &ldquo;the hill&rdquo;; of old the scene of many a 
tournament and feat of Norman chivalry, but now much used as a show place 
for cattle, where those who buy and sell beeves and other beasts resort at 
stated periods.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps Borrow inherited from his father&mdash;the conqueror of Big Ben 
Brain, &ldquo;whose skin was brown and dusky as that of a 
toad&rdquo;&mdash;the love of fisticuffs which was so prominently marked in
his career.&nbsp; It was this which led him to become the pupil in boxing 
of &ldquo;the terrible Thurtell,&rdquo; executed for the murder of Weare, 
January 9th, 1824 (his father, Thomas Thurtell, was Sheriff of Norwich in 
1815, Mayor in 1828, and died April 8th, 1846, at the good old age of 
eighty-one.&nbsp; He lived at Harford Hall Farm, Lakenham, a largish house 
standing back from the highway, towards the end of the Ipswich Road, on the
left-hand side going from Norwich, some little distance this side of 
Harford Bridges in the river valley below).&nbsp; The celebrated chapter on
&ldquo;The Bruisers of England&rdquo; (&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; Chap.&nbsp; 
XXVI.) has been warmly applauded by many writers as a very fine example of 
Borrow&rsquo;s style.&nbsp; That it undoubtedly is, but some critics were 
unsympathetic about pugilism, amongst them the late Rev. Whitwell Elwin, 
who, in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (January-April, 1857), wrote: 
&ldquo;Mr. Borrow&rsquo;s notions of what constitutes cant have not always 
been the same.&nbsp; In his &lsquo;Gypsies of Spain&rsquo; he speaks of 
pugilistic combats as &lsquo;disgraceful and brutalizing 
exhibitions,&rsquo; but in the Appendix to &lsquo;The Romany Rye&rsquo; we 
find that he now considers such language to be cant.&nbsp; This is one of 
the cases in which second thoughts are worst.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another reviewer
deprecates Borrow&rsquo;s glorifying attitude towards &ldquo;the very worst
amongst the bad, such as David Haggart and John Thurtell; and not content 
with turning away the edge of an instinctive condemnation of crime, 
actually entitles the prize-fighters, the brutality of whose profession can
scarcely be exaggerated, &lsquo;the priests of an old 
religion.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; More recently, while advocating <!-- page 
23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>the 
Children&rsquo;s Bill in the House of Commons (March 24th, 1908), Mr. Shaw 
said that &ldquo;George Borrow never did a worse service to humanity than 
by writing &lsquo;Lavengro,&rsquo; with its glorification of vagabond 
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Though one cannot acquit Borrow of inconsistency, we 
must remember that &ldquo;The Gypsies of Spain&rdquo; was written in 1840, 
and that he sent a notice of it to Mr. Brandram of the Bible Society in 
March of that year, ending his letter with the words: &ldquo;I hope yet to 
die in the cause of my Redeemer.&rdquo;&nbsp; For my part, I am convinced 
that Borrow&rsquo;s real opinion of pugilism is contained in several 
passages of the Appendix to &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; where he 
justifies &ldquo;his favourite pursuits, hunting after strange characters, 
or analysing strange words and names,&rdquo; and expressed the belief that 
he would not be refused admission to heaven because of &ldquo;some 
inclination to put on certain gloves, not white kid, with any friend who 
may be inclined for a little old-English diversion, and a readiness to take
a glass of ale, with plenty of malt in it, and as little hop as may well 
be&mdash;ale at least two years old&mdash;with the aforesaid friend when 
the diversion is over.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says he is &ldquo;not ashamed to 
speak to a beggar in rags, and will associate with anybody, provided he can
gratify a laudable curiosity.&rdquo;&nbsp; More emphatically still, he 
asks: &ldquo;Can the rolls of the English aristocracy exhibit names 
belonging to more heroic men than those who were called respectively 
Pearce, Cribb, and Spring?&rdquo;&nbsp; Both &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; be it noted, were written long after 
Borrow&rsquo;s association with the Bible Society had come to an end.</p>
<p>Those who wish to visualize in some degree the rendezvous of &ldquo;the 
bruisers of England, men of tremendous renown,&rdquo; should look upon the 
building, once the Bowling Green Hotel, by Chapel Field Gardens.&nbsp; It 
is now an Orphan&rsquo;s Home, bought for that purpose for seven hundred 
pounds in January, 1870, but the initials &ldquo;R.G.&rdquo; on the north 
wall still recall the memory of Richard Gurney, &ldquo;the retired coachman
with one leg,&rdquo; who died August 11th, 1829, aged forty-eight.&nbsp; 
The stabling still remains in use, but the bowling green now forms part of 
the property of the Bethel Hospital: it adjoins the theatre, and is 
occupied by tennis courts for the recreation of the patients.&nbsp; The 
<!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
24</span>Bowling Green Hotel in its heyday was a place of much importance; 
for being so close to the theatre, it was the chosen hostelry for many 
great theatrical stars&mdash;Mrs. Charles Kean and others.&nbsp; Many 
amusing anecdotes are told of the guests in a booklet on &ldquo;Old Norfolk
Inns,&rdquo; published by Messrs. Jarrold in 1888, but now unfortunately 
out of print.&nbsp; Borrow gives an account of the mixed assemblage at this
inn, gathered for the great fight of July 17th, 1820, between Ned Painter 
(&ldquo;Ned Flatnose&rdquo;), of Norwich, and Oliver.</p>
<p>He is wrong about the planting of the trees in Chapel Field &ldquo;at 
the restoration of sporting Charles,&rdquo; for they were planted in 1746, 
by Sir Thomas Churchman, then lessee of the Field.</p>
<p>A good contemporary account of the big fight, in which Painter won, may 
be found in &ldquo;Norfolk Annals&rdquo; (compiled from the files of the 
<i>Norfolk Chronicle</i>), vol. i. p. 184.&nbsp; This was Painter&rsquo;s 
last appearance in the prize-ring.&nbsp; He was landlord of the White Hart,
just above St. Peter Mancroft Church, from 1823 to 1835, and in that inn 
there is still a portrait of the famous Ned.&nbsp; He occupied the meadows 
on which Thorpe Station was built.</p>

<p>Borrow&rsquo;s introduction of the celebrated fast trotter 
&ldquo;Marshland Shales&rdquo; at the Tombland Fair of March 19th, 1818, is
an anachronism, for that noble animal did not present himself on the Castle
Hill till 1827.&nbsp; He had been sold for 305 guineas in 1810, and again 
sold in 1827; he died in 1835, aged thirty-three.&nbsp; Sir Walter Gilbey 
states that &ldquo;though the Norfolk Hackney achieved its fame through 
Blaze (foaled 1733), who begat the original Shales, foaled in 1755, and the
foundations of this invaluable breed were thus laid in George II.&rsquo;s 
time, we must have regard to the period during which the breed achieved its
celebrity both at home and abroad, and that period is the long reign of 
George III.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Knapp expresses himself as much terrified by 
the invasion of the free path by &ldquo;a party rushing madly up, striving 
to keep pace with a mettlesome steed . . . at the sight of whose enormous 
hoofs and shaggy fetlocks you are all but ready to perish.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Such niggling super refinement would be quite repugnant to Borrow&rsquo;s 
highway robustious temperament.</p>

was at this Horse Fair that he became conscious of being watched by 
someone, till at last he was accosted: &ldquo;What! the sap-engro?&nbsp; 
Lor! the sap-engro upon the hill!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Jasper revealed 
himself.&nbsp; He had been dodging about inspecting young Borrow, and said 
he believed Borrow had felt his presence&mdash;&ldquo;a sign, brother, that
we are akin, that we are <i>dui palor</i>&mdash;two relations.&nbsp; Your 
blood beat when mine was near, as mine always does at the coming of a 
brother.&rdquo;&nbsp; The two pals walked on over &ldquo;the old Norman 
Bridge&rdquo; till they reached the gypsy tents on Mousehold, where Borrow 
had a memorable conversation with Jasper (Ambrose Smith), and incurred the 
wrath of the malignant Mrs. Herne, who objected to the strange Gorgio 
&ldquo;stealing&rdquo; her language.&nbsp; But he continually consorted 
with Jasper, studying the language, the characters, and the manners of the 
gypsies.&nbsp; So quickly did he pick up Romany words that Jasper said: 
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll no longer call you Sap-engro, brother, but rather 
Lav-engro, which in the language of the Gorgios meaneth Word 
Master.&rdquo;&nbsp; The handsome Tawno Chikno would have preferred to call
him Cooro-mengro, as he had found him &ldquo;a pure fist 
master.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Herne could not stand this intimacy, for she so 
hated the Gorgio that she said she would like to mix a little poison with 
his water, so she left her party with her blessing, and this <i>gillie</i> 
to cheer their hearts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In all kinds of weather<br />
Have we lived together;<br />
But now we are parted,<br />
I goes broken hearted.<br />
Ye are no longer Rommany.<br />
To gain a bad brother,<br />
Ye have lost a good mother.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>About three years later, Lavengro and Jasper had that conversation on 
Mousehold, in which this classic passage occurs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Life is sweet, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s night and day, brother, both sweet 
things; <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
26</span>sun, moon and stars, brother, all sweet things; there&rsquo;s 
likewise the wind on the heath.&nbsp; Life is very sweet, brother; who 
would wish to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would wish to die&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk like a gorgio&mdash;which is the same as talking like a 
fool&mdash;were you a Rommany Chal you would talk wiser.&nbsp; Wish to die 
indeed!&nbsp; A Rommany Chal would wish to live for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In sickness, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the sun and stars, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In blindness, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the wind on the heath, brother; if I could only 
feel that, I would gladly live for ever.&nbsp; Dosta, we&rsquo;ll now go to
the tents and put on the gloves; and I&rsquo;ll try to make you feel what a
sweet thing it is to be alive, brother!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s school era was closed appropriately, says Dr. Knapp, by 
the mysterious distemper already referred to, which would, he thought, end 
his life; but as he recovered a career had to be decided upon, and, 
apparently on the advice of his friend Roger Kerrison, the law was 
chosen.&nbsp; So on Monday, March 30th, 1819, George Borrow was articled 
for a term of five years to the highly respectable firm of Simpson &amp; 
Rackham, whose offices were in Tuck&rsquo;s Court, St. Giles&rsquo;s, still
occupied by solicitors in the persons of Messrs. Leathes Prior &amp; 
Son.&nbsp; &ldquo;So,&rdquo; says Borrow, &ldquo;I sat behind a desk many 
hours in the day, ostensibly engaged in transcribing documents of various 
kinds.&nbsp; The scene of my labours was a strange old house, occupying one
side of a long and narrow court, into which, however, the greater number of
the windows looked not, but into an extensive garden, filled with fruit 
trees, in the rear of a large handsome house, belonging to a highly 
respectable gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was William Simpson, Town Clerk of
Norwich from 1826 till his death, in 1834, having succeeded Elisha de 
Hague, who attested Borrow&rsquo;s articles.&nbsp; The portraits of both 
these worthies hang in Blackfriars Hall, that of De Hague by Sir William 
Beechey, that of Simpson by Thomas Phillips, whose son, H. W. Phillips, 
painted Borrow&rsquo;s portrait in 1843: it was exhibited at the Royal 
Academy in 1844.&nbsp; As articled clerk Borrow <!-- page 27--><a 
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>lived at Mr. 
Simpson&rsquo;s house in the Upper Close, which has long since 
disappeared.</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson was a genial and indulgent employer, so probably young 
Borrow found little to prevent him from bringing Ab Gwilym into company 
with Blackstone: by adopting the law the ardent young linguist had not 
ceased to be Lav-engro; indeed, the acquisition of languages was his chief 
pursuit.&nbsp; He already knew, in a way, Latin, Greek, Irish, French, 
Italian, Spanish, and what Dr. Knapp calls &ldquo;the broken jargon&rdquo; 
then current in England as gypsy.&nbsp; From a misshapen Welsh groom this 
queer lawyer&rsquo;s clerk learned Welsh pronunciation, and to the 
consternation of his employer, &ldquo;turned Sir Edward from the 
door,&rdquo; and gladly admitted the petty versifier Parkerson who sold his
sheets to the highest bidder in the streets; worse even than this was his 
audacity in contending against a wealthy archdeacon that Ab Gwilym was the 
superior of Ovid.&nbsp; This gentleman was probably the Rev. John 
Oldershaw, Archdeacon of Norfolk from 1797 till his death, January 31st, 
1847, aged ninety-three.&nbsp; As he was one of the most active magistrates
in the county, he would naturally be on friendly terms with so prominent a 
lawyer as Mr. Simpson, whose handsome wife, moreover, was in the habit of 
giving entertainments which rather worried her spouse.&nbsp; The episode of
the Wake of Freya, included in Chapter XX. of Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s edition of 
&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; and the fine eulogy of Crome in the succeeding 
chapter, should inspire every reader&rsquo;s genuine interest.&nbsp; Here 
is the memorable Crome passage: &ldquo;A living master?&nbsp; Why, there he
comes! thou hast had him long, he has long guided thy young hand towards 
the excellence which is yet far from thee, but which thou canst attain if 
thou shouldst persist and wrestle, even as he has done, midst gloom and 
despondency&mdash;ay, and even contempt; he who now comes up the creaking 
stair to thy little studio in the second floor to inspect thy last effort 
before thou departest, the little stout man whose face is very dark, and 
whose eye is vivacious; that man has attained excellence, destined some day
to be acknowledged, though not till he is cold, and his mortal part 
returned to its kindred clay.&nbsp; He has painted, not pictures of the 
world, but English pictures, such as <!-- page 28--><a 
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Gainsborough himself 
might have done; beautiful rural pieces, with trees which might well tempt 
the wild birds to perch upon them; thou needest not run to Rome, brother, 
after pictures of the world, whilst at home there are pictures of England; 
nor needest thou even go to London, the big city, in search of a master, 
for thou hast one at home in the old East Anglian town who can instruct 
thee whilst thou needest instruction.&nbsp; Better stay at home, brother, 
at least for a season, and toil and strive &rsquo;midst groanings and 
despondency till thou hast attained excellence even as he has 
done&mdash;the little dark man with the brown coat and the top-boots, whose
name will one day be considered the chief ornament of the old town, and 
whose works will at no distant period rank among the proudest pictures of 
England&mdash;and England against the world! thy master, my brother, thy, 
at present, all too little considered master&mdash;Crome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow was frankly bored by his experiences in law; he tired of his 
surroundings, but relaxation came when an old couple gave him a venerable 
collection of Danish ballads, jetsam of the sea, left with the yeoman and 
his wife by some shipwrecked red-haired man.&nbsp; This was enough to waken
his greedy curiosity, and he at once shook off his listlessness, and set to
work to learn Danish, by the aid of a Danish Bible bought of a Muggletonian
preacher, who was also a bookseller.&nbsp; In less than a month he was able
to read his prize.&nbsp; A correspondent in &ldquo;Notes and Queries&rdquo;
(April 3rd, 1852) suggested that Borrow confounded Muggleton with 
Huntington, which, indeed, seems likely enough.</p>

<p>In the old Corporation Library Borrow was enabled to pursue his studies 
in Scandinavian literature, and having become acquainted with William 
Taylor, &ldquo;one of the most extraordinary men that Norwich ever 
produced,&rdquo; learned German from him with wonderful rapidity.&nbsp; He 
was a frequent visitor at Taylor&rsquo;s house, 21, King Street, which has 
just been demolished for the extension of some motor works.&nbsp; Though a 
pronounced Free-thinker, Taylor was a friend of Southey, and gave his young
pupil excellent advice.&nbsp; Mr. Elwin once said to me that most of the 
Norwich antipathetic references to Borrow arose from his waywardness and 
wildness as a youth, and considered that <!-- page 29--><a 
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>there was no evidence 
that he was ever dissipated or loose in his life.&nbsp; We may largely 
discount Harriet Martineau&rsquo;s acid references to Taylor&rsquo;s 
harum-scarum young men, especially as she romanced about that very wild 
young man Polidori, Byron&rsquo;s erstwhile physician, who, during his stay
in Norwich&mdash;1817-8&mdash;was ever at the Martineaus&rsquo; house.</p>

<p>Whatever were the faults of &ldquo;Godless Billy,&rdquo; as the Norwich 
people called Taylor, it was at his table that Borrow met the most 
intellectual people of Norwich, and of visitors who were amongst 
Taylor&rsquo;s admirers.&nbsp; One of these, in July, 1821, was Dr. Bowring
(afterwards Sir John), so unjustly and rancorously pilloried in Appendix 
XI. of &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; in 1857.&nbsp; Another guest at the 
same time was Dr. Lewis Evans, physician to the Norfolk and Norwich 
Hospital, 1821-50, a hot-tempered Welshman who had served with distinction 
in Spain during the Peninsular War.&nbsp; In 1823 William Taylor declared 
that Borrow translated with facility and elegance twenty different 
languages.</p>
<p>On Monday, February 11th, 1822, Captain Borrow made his will, and 
perhaps it was not a mere coincidence that it was a Monday, also on 
February 11th, but back in 1793, that he married his beloved wife at East 
Dereham.&nbsp; The old soldier again became concerned about the fate of 
George when out of his articles, and was anything but heartened by being 
informed that the young lawyer&rsquo;s clerk had acquired Armenian from a 
book obtained from a clergyman&rsquo;s widow, who took a fancy, so he says,
to him, and even drew his portrait&mdash;the expression of his countenance 
putting her in mind of Alfieri&rsquo;s Saul.&nbsp; The worthy Captain died 
February 28th, 1824, and was buried in St. Giles&rsquo;s churchyard on 
March 4th.&nbsp; There never appears to have been any memorial stone, and I
have found it impossible to locate the exact position of the grave.&nbsp; 
As a corner of the churchyard was cut off to widen the street, and to 
remove a dangerous corner, under the City of Norwich Act of 1867, it is 
quite likely that the remains are now under the roadway.</p>
<p>In an obituary notice in the <i>Norwich Mercury</i> of March 6th, <!-- 
page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>1824, 
Captain Borrow&rsquo;s passing is described thus: &ldquo;He rose from his 
bed about four, apparently as well as he has usually been in the winter 
time; returned to it without the least assistance, and in less than a 
quarter of an hour was a corpse in the arms of his sons, leaving those who 
knew his worth and deeply lament his loss.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It will be a
shocking thing for George and John,&rdquo; wrote Allday Kerrison to his 
brother Roger.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s articles with Simpson &amp; Rackham expired on March 
30th, 1824, and a new epoch, packed with extraordinary vicissitudes, was to
follow.</p>

<p>Borrow describes his father&rsquo;s death in the following memorable 
passage in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo;: &ldquo;Clasping his hands he uttered 
another name clearly.&nbsp; It was the name of Christ.&nbsp; With that name
upon his lips the brave old soldier sank back upon my bosom, and with his 
hands still clasped yielded up his soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; This concluded Volume
I. of the original edition of the work.</p>
<p>He begins the first chapter of the second volume abruptly, thus: 
&ldquo;One-and-ninepence, sir, or the things which you have brought with 
you will be taken from you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was Borrow&rsquo;s first greeting in London when, on the morning of
April 2nd, 1824, he alighted from the Norwich coach in the yard of the Swan
with Two Necks, in a lane now swallowed up by Gresham Street.&nbsp; He 
proceeded to the lodgings of his friend Roger Kerrison, at 16, Millman 
Street, Bedford Row; but in May he had developed such alarming, even 
suicidal, symptoms that Kerrison, fearing he might be involved in a 
tragedy, hastily moved off to Soho.&nbsp; Borrow was now to begin the real 
battle of life, and he had to put in practice, as best he might, his motto,
&ldquo;Fear God, and take your own part.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had left behind in
Norwich the mother he loved so well, she who ever defended him when his odd
speeches and unconventional proceedings called forth criticism or 
censure.&nbsp; His friend William Taylor had given him introductions in 
London, and &ldquo;honest six-foot-three,&rdquo; conscious of possessing 
unusual powers, mental and physical, set forth to seek literary work.&nbsp;
So, with some papers from a little green box, he looked up Sir Richard 
Phillips, in Tavistock Square, presented him a letter from Mr. So-and-So 
(W. Taylor), and was <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>promptly assured &ldquo;literature is a 
drug.&rdquo;&nbsp; The following Sunday, however, he dined with the old 
publisher, who was soon to retire to Brighton, and was commissioned to 
compile six volumes of &ldquo;Celebrated Trials,&rdquo; etc., &ldquo;from 
the earliest records to the year 1825.&rdquo;&nbsp; What a caprice of Fate 
that the young aspirant should, on the very threshold of his adult career, 
be thrown into these coulisses of criminal biography!&nbsp; That a taste 
already keen to search out the birds of prey that haunt the fringe of 
decorous society, should be immersed, as it were, in a stream of criminal 
records!&nbsp; Old songs of Denmark, the poems of Ab Gwilym (&ldquo;worth 
half a dozen of Chaucer&rdquo;!), the &ldquo;romance in the German 
style,&rdquo; all were ruthlessly swept aside to give place to a catena of 
lives of notorious evildoers!</p>
<p>The Lives and Trials appeared in March, 1825, with a preface by Sir 
Richard; but without Borrow&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; The intellectual 
impressions which this task, reaching 3,600 pages, produced on 
Borrow&rsquo;s mind were, said the publisher, &ldquo;mournful.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The grisly and sordid stories of crime and criminals he had to edit reduced
him to a state of gloomy depression.</p>

<p>His melancholy was abated by an unexpected visit from his soldier-artist
brother (April 29th, 1824), of whom, after an affectionate embrace, he 
asked: &ldquo;How is my mother, and how is the dog?&rdquo;&nbsp; Old Mrs. 
Borrow, down in Willow Lane, was getting past her fits of crying over the 
loss of her husband, and frequently had the Prayer Book in her hand, but 
oftener the Bible.&nbsp; John Borrow had been offered one hundred pounds by
a Committee to paint Robert Hawkes, Mayor of Norwich in 1822, a prominent 
draper, who became extremely popular for &ldquo;the nobly liberal spirit in
which he sustained the splendour of civic hospitality.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. T. 
O. Springfield, commonly called &ldquo;T.O.,&rdquo; was spokesman of the 
Committee&mdash;a little watchmaker with a hump, Borrow called him.&nbsp; 
Dr. Knapp denies that he was a watchmaker, but such he was in his early 
days, though he became very wealthy through speculations in silk, and Mayor
of Norwich 1829 and 1836.&nbsp; Quite a character, his tombstone in the 
Rosary cemetery bears this honourable record: &ldquo;A merciful magistrate,
a successful merchant, A consistent politician, A benevolent benefactor, 
<!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>He 
devoted the energies of a vigorous intellect, and the sympathies of a warm 
heart, to the prosperity of his native city and the welfare of its 
inhabitants.&nbsp; Beloved, honoured and regretted, He died April 24th, 
1855.&rdquo;&nbsp; John did not feel equal to painting little Mr. Hawkes 
&ldquo;striding under the Norman arch out of the cathedral,&rdquo; but 
said, &ldquo;I can introduce you to a great master of the heroic, fully 
competent to do justice to your mayor.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;T.O.&rdquo; 
thought the money should not go to London, but John prevailed, and so came 
up to London to interview B. R. Haydon, who, owning himself confoundedly 
hard up, at once accepted the commission.&nbsp; But George comes in as 
Haydon&rsquo;s <i>beau ideal</i> for that face of Pharaoh the artist 
desired to paint; later on Borrow asked Haydon for a sitting, saying he 
would &ldquo;sooner lose a thousand pounds than not have the honour of 
appearing in the picture.&rdquo;&nbsp; No trace of any such portrait can be
found.&nbsp; Haydon&rsquo;s portrait of Hawkes hangs in St. Andrew&rsquo;s 
Hall in close proximity to that of his friend &ldquo;T.O.,&rdquo; painted 
by Philip Westcott.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I have often thought,&rdquo; says Borrow, very 
characteristically, &ldquo;what a capital picture might have been made by 
my brother&rsquo;s friend, if, instead of making the mayor issue out of the
Norman arch, he had painted him moving under the sign of the Checquers 
(<i>sic</i>), or the Three Brewers, with mace&mdash;yes, with 
mace&mdash;the mace appears in the picture issuing out of the Norman arch 
behind the mayor&mdash;but likewise with Snap, and with whiffler, quart 
pot, and frying-pan, Billy Blind, and Owlenglass, Mr. Petulengro, and 
Pakomovna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s real literary career had begun with the translation of 
&ldquo;Faustus&rdquo; (1825), a rather lurid German work by F. von Klinger,
one of whose plays, <i>Sturm und Drang</i>, gave the name to a whole period
of German literature.&nbsp; The book was received very unfavourably, but 
Borrow meant having his Danish Ballads published, and in 1826 they were 
issued by S. Wilkin, Upper Haymarket, Norwich, in an edition of five 
hundred copies, of which two hundred were reserved for Norwich and sold at 
half a guinea each copy; the rest went to London.&nbsp; Allan Cunningham 
wrote a very eulogistic metrical dedication.&nbsp; The subscription list 
reveals a very varied list of subscribers, including Bishop Bathurst, 
Benjamin Haydon, Thomas Campbell, and <!-- page 34--><a 
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>John Thurtell, who was 
hanged before the book appeared.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s biographers generally
treat these ballads with scarcely veiled contempt, though Lockhart, whose 
brilliant renderings of Spanish ballads are unsurpassed, wrote of his 
complete skill in the Scandinavian languages, and his &ldquo;copious body 
of translations from their popular minstrelsies, not at all to be 
confounded with that of certain versifiers. . . . His Norse ditties have 
the unforgeable stamp of authenticity on every line.&rdquo;&nbsp; W. Bodham
Donne, a well-known critic, even went so far as to rank them above 
Macaulay&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lays of Ancient Rome.&rdquo;&nbsp; A fine facsimile
edition of Borrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Romantic Ballads&rdquo; was brought out by
Messrs. Jarrold in the early part of this year.</p>
<p>A rupture with Phillips, almost inevitable, set Borrow wandering, and 
very soon he became acquainted with the old fruit-woman who found a valid 
defence for theft in the history of &ldquo;the blessed Mary 
Flanders,&rdquo; a dog&rsquo;s-eared volume of &ldquo;Moll Flanders,&rdquo;
wherein Borrow found &ldquo;the air, the style, the spirit of the writer of
the book&rdquo; which first taught him to read&mdash;Defoe, of 
course.&nbsp; This classic is &ldquo;supreme as a realistic picture of low 
life in the large.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A quite different figure appears in the person of Francis Arden, a 
handsome young Irishman with whom Borrow became acquainted in the 
coffee-room of an hotel, and with him obtained some knowledge of &ldquo;the
strange and eccentric places of London.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Arden burst out 
laughing one day Borrow said he would, perhaps, have joined if it were ever
his wont to laugh, and his friends said that, though he enjoyed a joke, he 
did not seem to have the power of laughing.&nbsp; But in Borrow we expect 
contrarieties, so we find him saying that when he detected a man poking fun
at him in Welsh he flung back his head, closed his eyes, and laughed aloud;
and later on, walking in Wales with the rain at his back, he flung his 
umbrella over his shoulder and laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, how a man laughs 
who has a good umbrella when he has the rain at his back&rdquo; 
(&ldquo;Wild Wales,&rdquo; pp. 301, 470).</p>
<p>Passing by Borrow&rsquo;s meetings with the Armenian merchant, we come 
to the time when, as he says, he found himself reduced to his last 
half-crown, and set about writing the &ldquo;Life and Adventures <!-- page 
35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>of Joseph Sell,
the Great Traveller,&rdquo; an entirely fictitious personage.&nbsp; This 
was completed within a week, towards the end of May, 1825, and the story 
brought the author a welcome twenty pounds.&nbsp; Such is the record.&nbsp;
Dr. Knapp believes that there was such a story, probably part of a series, 
but Mr. Jenkins gives good reasons for thinking that &ldquo;Joseph 
Sell&rdquo; was not written till 1829, when Borrow would more probably be 
in want of money than just after payment for his &ldquo;Trials&rdquo; (in 
every sense trials) from Phillips.&nbsp; Anyway, on May 24th, 1825, Borrow 
left London.&nbsp; At starting he encountered Arden driving a cabriolet, 
who asked him whither he was bound.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
replied Borrow, &ldquo;all I can say is that I am about to leave 
London.&rdquo;&nbsp; Being out of condition, he tired of walking, mounted a
coach, &ldquo;tipped the blunt&rdquo; to the driver, and alighted at 
Amesbury, near Stonehenge, whence he began a ramble which became a perfect 
Iliad of strange happenings.&nbsp; His health improved, his spirits rose, 
as he tramped on, his journeyings varying from twenty to twenty-five miles 
a day.&nbsp; On the fifth day of his tramp he met at an inn the mysterious 
stranger who &ldquo;touched,&rdquo; as Borrow himself did, against the evil
eye; Dr. Johnson was an habitual toucher, and even Macaulay owned to a 
kindred feeling.&nbsp; While a guest of the &ldquo;touching&rdquo; 
gentleman, Borrow was introduced to the Rev. Mr. Platitude, a notable 
character in his literary portrait gallery&mdash;&ldquo;he did not go to 
college a gentleman; he went an ass and returned a prig,&rdquo; writes 
Borrow fiercely.&nbsp; No biographer, so far as I know, has identified 
Platitude, but Mr. Donne evidently knew him, for he calls Borrow&rsquo;s 
account a &ldquo;gross and unfair caricature.&rdquo;&nbsp; I believe I have
identified &ldquo;the rascally Unitarian minister who went over to the High
Church,&rdquo; with the Rev. Theophilus Browne, Fellow and Tutor of 
Peterhouse, Cambridge, who quitted the Church for conscience sake, obtained
an appointment at the York Unitarian College, and was minister at the 
Octagon Chapel in 1809, but was paid to resign the following year.&nbsp; He
died at Bath in May, 1835.&nbsp; The historian of the Octagon applies 
Milton&rsquo;s line to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;New Presbyter is but old Priest writ large.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
36</span>Arriving at Tamworth, Borrow entered a cottage inn, and, as was 
his custom, called &ldquo;House!&rdquo; as loud as he could.&nbsp; Whilst 
drinking his beer he cheered the heart of the sorrowful Jack Slingsby by 
buying his whole tinker&rsquo;s stock-in-trade&mdash;beat, plant, pony, and
all&mdash;concluding that &ldquo;a tinker is his own master, a scholar is 
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor Slingsby had been driven off the road by the great 
Flaming Tinman, &ldquo;Black Jack,&rdquo; whose clan name was Anselo Herne,
who, thrusting a Bible into Slingsby&rsquo;s mouth, forced him to swear his
Bible oath that he would surrender his beat.&nbsp; Here was a truly 
picturesque situation after Borrow&rsquo;s own taste, and, no doubt with a 
joyful heart, he paid Slingsby five pounds ten shillings for his 
tinker&rsquo;s outfit, bought a wagoner&rsquo;s frock from the landlady, 
and felt ready enough to encounter the dreaded &ldquo;Black 
Jack.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Borrow avers that he fled from London &ldquo;from fear of 
consumption,&rdquo; that he must do something or go mad, so, having a 
knowledge of smithing that enabled him to acquire the tinkering craft, he 
became a sort of Petulengro himself.&nbsp; A few days after pitching his 
tent in Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle, near Willenhall, as he slept against an ash 
tree, a voice seemed to cry in his ear Danger! Danger! and he awoke to see 
Leonora, a pretty gypsy girl of thirteen, wearing a handsome necklace of 
corals and gold.&nbsp; She offered him a <i>manricli</i>, or cake, saying 
&ldquo;Eat, pretty brother, grey-haired brother.&rdquo;&nbsp; After some 
demur, he ate part of it; it was poisoned, and he fell into a swoon.&nbsp; 
Soon he heard the voice of the malicious old hag Mrs. Herne, who, gloating 
over her enemy, told him he had taken <i>drows</i>, as, however he began to
move they set their <i>juggal</i> (dog) at him; but the animal, fled from 
the flash of the tinker&rsquo;s eye, and Mrs. Herne realised that he would 
live&mdash;the <i>dook</i> (spirit of divination) told her so.&nbsp; The 
arrival of the Welsh preacher Peter Williams, and his wife Winifred, in 
their cart put the gypsy witch-wife and her daughter to flight.&nbsp; The 
Welshman administered some oil, which, after two hours of suspense, and 
with the help of an opiate, saved the life of Lavengro.&nbsp; During this 
companionship Borrow found that Williams suffered excruciating spiritual 
terrors from the conviction that he had committed the sin against the Holy 
Ghost&mdash;<i>pechod Ysprydd Glan</i>!</p>
<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
37</span>Borrow left his Welsh friends to join no less a personage than 
Jasper Petulengro, &ldquo;one of the clibberty-clabber,&rdquo; quoted Peter
from a Welsh poet; Borrow&rsquo;s pal had a wondrous story to tell of Mrs. 
Herne, of the &ldquo;drows,&rdquo; who had &ldquo;been her own 
hinjiri,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> hanged herself.&nbsp; The girl Leonora told 
Jasper that she had tracked Borrow and found him, alive and well, 
&lsquo;discussing religion with a Methody, and that when she told the old 
woman, Mrs. Herne said it was all up with her, and she must take a long 
journey.&nbsp; In March, 1911, died Isaac Herne, of the same family, son of
beautiful Sinfi; he was known as &ldquo;King of the Gypsies,&rdquo; and to 
the last would tell of his meetings and talks with the &ldquo;Romany 
Rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Unlike his clanswoman, who was buried &ldquo;like a Roman
woman of the old blood,&rdquo; he was buried in gorgious fashion&mdash;in 
the graveyard of Manston Church, near Leeds.</p>
<p>Borrow soon parted from Jasper, and settled himself in the beautiful 
Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle, where he had the historic fight with the 
&ldquo;Flaming Tinman,&rdquo; getting the victory by using his &ldquo;Long 
Melford,&rdquo; on the advice of that towering and handsome female bearing 
the name of Isopel Berners, who now comes on the scene, and who will ever 
remain one of the most fascinating figures in the wonderful gallery of 
Borrovian characters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw such a face and figure,&rdquo; exclaims Borrow, 
&ldquo;both regal&mdash;why, you look like Ingeborg, Queen of Norway; she 
had twelve brothers, you know, and could lick them all, though they were 
heroes&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On Dovrefeld in Norway,<br />
&nbsp;  Were once together seen,<br />
 The twelve heroic brothers<br />
&nbsp;  Of Ingeborg the queen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">(See &ldquo;Romantic Ballads,&rdquo; p. 
59.)</p>
<p>In Chapter XV. of &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; Borrow thus describes 
the last farewell to Belle, as he called her: &ldquo;I found the Romany 
party waiting for me, and everything in readiness for departing.&nbsp; Mr. 
Petulengro and Tawno Chikno were mounted on two old horses.&nbsp; The rest,
who intended to go to the fair, amongst whom were two or <!-- page 38--><a 
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>three women, were on 
foot.&nbsp; On arriving at the extremity of the plain, I looked towards the
dingle.&nbsp; Isopel Berners stood at the mouth, the beams of the early 
morning sun shone full on her noble face and figure.&nbsp; I waved my hand 
towards her.&nbsp; She slowly lifted up her right arm.&nbsp; I turned away,
and never saw Isopel Berners again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This little book, concerned chiefly with Norwich, cannot follow the 
wayfarings of Borrow, so enchantingly described in &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; 
and &ldquo;The Romany Rye,&rdquo; in chapters which justify to the full Mr.
Birrell&rsquo;s enthusiastic admiration when he wrote: &ldquo;The 
delightful, the bewitching, the never sufficiently to be praised George 
Borrow&mdash;Borrow, the Friend of Man, at whose bidding lassitude and 
languor strike their tents and flee; and health and spirits, adventure and 
human comradeship, take up the reins of life, whistle to the horses and 
away you go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is much to be hoped that the Borrow Celebration, to which this 
booklet is a modest contribution, may lead to a warmer appreciation in 
Norwich of one of the greatest men who ever trod her streets.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; has a thoroughly Borrovian ending, much in the
manner of Sterne, as many of Borrow&rsquo;s passages are.&nbsp; His 
pilgrimage of tinkering and adventurous vagrancy between May and August, 
1825, came to an end at Boston&mdash;&ldquo;a large town, situate at the 
entrance of an extensive firth&rdquo;&mdash;where a recruiting sergeant 
wished to enlist him for the service of the Honourable East India 
Company.&nbsp; But his references to Petulengro and Tawno Chikno disgusted 
the soldier, who exclaimed: &ldquo;Young fellow, I don&rsquo;t like your 
way of speaking; no, nor your way of looking.&nbsp; You are mad, sir; you 
are mad; and what&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; Why your hair is grey!&nbsp; You 
won&rsquo;t do for the Honourable Company&mdash;they like red.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t give you the shilling.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then 
Borrow soliloquizes: &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if Mr. Petulengro and 
Tawno Chikno came originally from India.&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;ll go 
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; So ends one of the most amazing fragments of 
autobiography that the world has ever seen; many readers we know leave 
these unwillingly and return to them again and again with unquenchable 
zest.&nbsp; Borrow was twenty-three when in the autumn of 1825 he was 
making his way to Norwich from Lincolnshire, and from <!-- page 39--><a 
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>then till his 
employment by the Bible Society in 1833, his movements were very 
uncertain.&nbsp; The intervening years have been called &ldquo;the veiled 
period&rdquo;&mdash;gloomy and mysterious, says Mr. Jenkins, but not 
utterly dark.&nbsp; He was in Norwich at Tombland Fair in April, 1827, the 
real date of his doffing his hat to that celebrated horse, &ldquo;Marshland
Shales,&rdquo; and towards the end of the year he was still in Willow Lane,
as is proved by entries in his mother&rsquo;s cash book, seen by Dr. 
Knapp.</p>
<p>Tired of inactivity, Borrow was in London in December, 1829, at 17, 
Great Russell Street, W.C., eagerly seeking work, scheming for a work on 
the Songs of Scandinavia, jointly with Bowring, which came to nothing.</p>
<p>It is curious that in a letter to Bowring of September 14th, 1830, he 
proposes to call on him one evening, as early rising kills him.&nbsp; Quite
a strange expression for so open-air a wanderer.&nbsp; That Borrow could 
not secure employment in the ordinary avenues of the professions and 
commerce is hardly to be wondered at; he preferred the society of 
vagabonds, into which he had been driven by his own inclinations as much 
as, or more than, by force of circumstances.&nbsp; His brother John told 
him that his want of success in life was more owing to his being unlike 
other people than to any other cause.&nbsp; His isolating and aggressive 
pride engendered a tactlessness which often spoilt any chances of 
advancement that came his way.&nbsp; But he had dogged determination, 
which, to quote Mr. Jenkins, &ldquo;was to carry him through the most 
critical period of his life, enable him to earn the approval of those in 
whose interests he worked, and eventually achieve fame and an unassailable 
place in English literature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It does not come within the scope of this local souvenir to follow 
Borrow in his career under the Bible Society in Russia and the Peninsula; 
but we must just note that he obtained his appointment with that society 
through the Rev. Francis Cunningham, a brother-in-law of the great banker 
J. J. Gurney, of Earlham, having married his sister Richenda at Earlham 
Church in 1816.&nbsp; He became Rector of Pakefield in 1814, and of 
Lowestoft from 1830 till his death in August, 1863.</p>

<p><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>To
this gentleman Borrow was introduced by a young farmer, no doubt Mr. 
Skepper, of Oulton Hall, on December 27th, 1832.&nbsp; It is believed that 
it was through the Batemans, of Norwich (of whom the late Sir Frederic 
Bateman, M.D., was best known), that the acquaintance with the Skeppers 
began, as the families had intermarried.&nbsp; On the very day of the 
introduction Mr. Cunningham wrote to the Rev. Andrew Brandram, Secretary of
the Bible Society, recommending Borrow as one who could read the Bible in 
thirteen languages&mdash;a very produceable person, of no very defined 
denomination of Christians, but, thought Mr. Cunningham, of certain 
Christian principle.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp errs in stating that Borrow owed this 
introduction to J. J. Gurney (&ldquo;Life of Borrow,&rdquo; i. p. 
152).&nbsp; Anyway, he was invited to interview the Bible Society 
secretaries, and when one of them hoped he had slept well, replied: 
&ldquo;I am not aware that I fell asleep on the road; I have walked from 
Norwich to London.&rdquo;&nbsp; He records that he did the hundred and 
twelve miles in twenty-seven hours, his outlay on the journey being 
5&frac12;d. for one pint of ale, half-pint of milk, a roll of bread, and 
two apples.&nbsp; Thus began the period of Bible distribution in Russia and
Spain, still a life crowded with adventures and risky situations&mdash;the 
tall, handsome, young Englishman now in a prison, and anon kissing his 
hands to a group of tittering nuns.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Bible in Spain&rdquo; 
was the chief enduring result of these experiences, a work which secured 
immediate popularity; moreover, the halo of the Bible Society shed a 
glamour of unquestionable respectability on Borrow&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; At 
Seville, in some inexplicable way, Borrow met Mrs. Clarke (born Mary 
Skepper), the widow of Lieut. Clarke, by whom she had the daughter 
Henrietta, the &ldquo;Hen&rdquo; of &ldquo;Wild Wales,&rdquo; who in 1865 
married Dr. MacOubrey, apparently both a physician and a barrister.&nbsp; 
Accompanied by her daughter, now about twenty-two, Mrs. Clarke arrived at 
Seville, and their <i>m&eacute;nage</i> there with Borrow was certainly 
curious; but on April 3rd, 1840, the whole party, including Hayim Ben 
Attar, his body servant, and Sidi Habismilk, his Arab steed, boarded the 
&ldquo;Royal Adelaide,&rdquo; bound for London, where she berthed on April 
16th.&nbsp; The Borrow party at once proceeded to the Spread Eagle <!-- 
page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Inn, 
Gracechurch Street, and on April 23rd, George Henry Borrow, 
&ldquo;gentleman, of the City of Norwich,&rdquo; was married at St. 
Peter&rsquo;s, Cornhill, in the City of London to Mary Clarke, 
&ldquo;widow, daughter of Edmund Skepper, Esquire.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the 
witnesses was Mr. John Pilgrim, a Norwich solicitor.&nbsp; About May 5th 
the little family left London for Oulton, long to be the home of Lav-engro,
and of his faithful and most helpful wife, who had an assured income of 
&pound;450, with something over from the estate.</p>

<p>Our Ulysses had now found a haven of refuge, and a permanent Calypso who
worthily held his heart to the end.</p>
<p>Oulton Cottage, with its banded firs and solemn solitary lake, alive 
with wild fowl, was an ideal place for Borrow.&nbsp; He had, in his early 
days, loved Norwich well, and might have settled here but for what Harriet 
Martineau styles the shout of laughter from all who remembered the old 
Norwich days, when he appeared &ldquo;as a devout agent of the Bible 
Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is unquestionable that the jog-trot 
&ldquo;daily-round-and-common-task&rdquo; citizens of Norwich looked 
askance at him as a sort of <i>lusus natur&aelig;</i>, what naturalists 
call a &ldquo;sport&rdquo;&mdash;not in the slangy sense.&nbsp; Mr. Egmont 
Hake (&ldquo;Macmillan&rsquo;s Magazine,&rdquo; 1882, Vol. XLV.) went so 
far as to say that Borrow was &ldquo;perhaps the handsomest man of his 
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the other hand, Caroline Fox, the Quakeress, who 
called on Borrow in October, 1843, described him as &ldquo;a tall, ungainly
man, with great physical strength, quick, penetrating eye, a confident 
manner, and a disagreeable tone and pronunciation.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was on 
April 11th, 1843, that Sir Robert Peel pronounced his striking eulogy on 
&ldquo;The Bible in Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Any appreciation of Borrow&rsquo;s works is out of the question in this 
outline survey.&nbsp; He professed a great liking for his &ldquo;Lives and 
Trials&rdquo;&mdash;how full were the Lives &ldquo;of wild and racy 
adventures, and in what racy, genuine language they were told.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These words are closely applicable to Borrow&rsquo;s own writings; many of 
the critics fell foul of them, though Lockhart said Borrow had &ldquo;a 
true eye for the picturesque, and a fund of real racy humour,&rdquo; while 
Elwin, fourteen years later (1857), praised his descriptions &ldquo;as 
accurate as they are <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>picturesque.&nbsp; They abound in dramatic and 
delicate strokes of nature, of which no extracts give an adequate idea, and
are painted with a force that brings men, events and prospects before the 
eye with the vividness of reality.&nbsp; In this power of verbal 
delineation Mr. Borrow has never been outdone. . . . His descriptions of 
scenery have a peculiar sublimity and grace.&rdquo;&nbsp; A little later, 
W. Bodham Donne, a Norfolk man and acute critic, said, &ldquo;We all read 
Mr. Borrow&rsquo;s books,&rdquo; but lamented his &ldquo;plunge into the 
worse than Irish bogs of Polemical Protestantism.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. 
Saintsbury, one of our foremost literary essayists, while asserting, in 
1886, that Borrow was not a popular author, stated that &ldquo;his works 
greatly influenced Longfellow and M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, especially the 
latter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Blackwood naturally disliked Borrow, said gypsies 
constituted nine-tenths of his stock-in-trade, and that his chief 
credential to London was a letter from &ldquo;an eccentric German 
teacher&rdquo;!&nbsp; To-day where will you find a competent scholarly 
critic who is not a whole-hearted admirer of Borrow&rsquo;s style?&nbsp; 
His grave and gay pictures of persons and places, are etched in with 
instinctive faithfulness, and clarity of atmosphere; always excepting such 
characters as were under the ban of his capricious hatred: &ldquo;Mr. 
Flamson,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Old Radical,&rdquo; Scott and his 
&ldquo;gentility nonsense,&rdquo; and so forth.&nbsp; It is doubtful if any
but lovers of the open road, can thoroughly enter into the Borrow 
fellowship, but only such as Mr. E. V. Lucas, Mr. Hilaire Belloc, of the 
comity of wayfaring men&mdash;initiates in the charities of the 
roads&mdash;men who love the dewy perfume of the meadows when the day is 
young, the blazing splendours of noon on the highway, and the magic of 
moonlight in many a dale, on many a hill.&nbsp; Men, moreover, who find 
nothing &ldquo;low&rdquo; in listening to the tapestried talk of wayside 
taverns, where, indeed, even to-day many a scrap of folk-lore and remnant 
of age-old superstitions may be learned.&nbsp; The spirit of Borrow has 
inspired and evolved the noble army of caravanners, with Lady Grosvenor and
Mr. J. Harris Stone at their head.&nbsp; The people who cannot appreciate 
Borrow are those who will not lift their eyes from the pavement to be rapt 
in admiration of a glorious sunset, to whom, indeed, Borrow would appear a 
silly enigma, or a boor.&nbsp; For, when &ldquo;the Heavens declare the 
glory <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
44</span>of God; and the firmament showeth his handy work,&rdquo; comes 
that rare time when the spirit&mdash;unconsciously worshipping&mdash;is 
uplifted in an ecstasy of wonder and joy, who then can but pity the dull 
eye ever abased to the grime of the trodden path?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In matters of taste you never are sure&mdash;<br />
Your curry&rsquo;s a poison, your tastelessness pure!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s sturdy forthrightness, his abhorrence of suave 
ambiguities and formal inanities, found vent in most vigorous and 
unmistakeable language; dogmatic <i>obiter dicta</i> came from his mouth or
his pen like so many cudgel-thwacks.&nbsp; His nature was tense and 
intense, very excitable and subject to aberrant moods&mdash;and he was 
often the victim of a false ply, as the French would say.&nbsp; It cannot 
be gainsaid that his suspicions of society ways, and of ordinarily 
conventional literary men, often betrayed him into tactless 
discourtesies.&nbsp; It is needless to repeat the anecdotes in which he 
appears in an unfavourable light, some of them probably exaggerations, as, 
for instance, the well-known story of Borrow snubbing Thackeray, as told by
Dr. Hake.&nbsp; Miss Jay, whose father was of the firm of Jay and Pilgrim, 
told me (November 22nd, 1893) that Borrow was loud in his denunciation of 
Thackeray&rsquo;s meanness on a certain occasion, and she utterly refused 
to believe Dr. Hake&rsquo;s version of the alleged boorishness at Hardwick 
Hall.&nbsp; Borrow was a man of many moods, and Miss Jay seems to have seen
him only in his brighter hours: she described him to me as open-hearted and
generous, always thought highly of good old ale, and liked Burgundy.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It puts fire into your veins,&rdquo; he would say; if he poured out 
wine for anyone, he was angry if they did not drink it.&nbsp; But she never
knew him to exceed, and, though she often saw him highly excited, never 
heard him swear.&nbsp; Very similar accounts appeared in the <i>Eastern 
Daily Press</i>, of October 1st, 1892, over the signature 
&ldquo;E.H.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Another friend of Borrow&rsquo;s with whom I had many talks was the late
Rev. Whitwell Elwin, at Booton Rectory.&nbsp; He was editor of the 
<i>Quarterly Review</i> (1854-60), and in 1857 had reviewed 
&ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; in excellent style,
under the <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
45</span>heading &ldquo;Roving Life in England.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Elwin and 
his wife were a most delightful couple, models of old-fashioned courtesy 
and heart-kindness.&nbsp; He knew Borrow well, and quite discredited the 
innuendoes and insinuations of many Norwich folk about him.&nbsp; It was a 
joke with the Murray circle that &ldquo;big Borrow was second fiddle at his
home, and there is ample testimony that his wife was a capable manager and 
looked after his affairs, literary as well as domestic.&rdquo;&nbsp; Though
Borrow boasted of his proficiency in the Norfolk dialect, Mr. Elwin told 
him that he had not cultivated it with his usual success.&nbsp; Mr. Elwin 
died January 1st, 1900, aged eighty-three.</p>
<p>Quite naturally old Mrs. Borrow grew lonely, and weary of the 
dilapidated house in Willow Lane, so she was removed to Oulton in 
September, 1849, and there she died August 16th, 1858.&nbsp; Under 
imperative orders from Dr. Hake, the Borrows left Oulton and got to 
Yarmouth, where they lived 1853-5 at John Sharman&rsquo;s, 169, King 
Street; 1856-7 at 37, Camperdown Place; 1858-9 at 39, Camperdown Place; and
finally, November, 1859, to June 30th, 1860, at 24, Trafalgar Place.&nbsp; 
These tarryings were, however, broken by many excursions&mdash;a most 
interesting one to his kinsfolk in Cornwall in 1853, to Wales in 1854, and 
the Isle of Man in 1855.</p>
<p>In 1860 Borrow, his wife, and step-daughter, Henrietta Clarke, took up 
their abode at 22, Hereford Square, Brompton, now distinguished by a County
Council tablet.&nbsp; There Borrow remained fourteen years.&nbsp; From 
there, in 1865, his step-daughter, Henrietta, married Dr. MacOubrey, and 
then came the most crushing blow of all&mdash;the death of his wife, 
January 30th, 1869.</p>
<p>One is reminded of the epitaph which I have seen on Mrs. Carlyle&rsquo;s
tombstone, in Haddington cemetery, in which Carlyle records that the light 
of his life is gone out; so Borrow&rsquo;s life was shadowed after his wife
passed away&mdash;she who wrote his letters, staved off the 
&ldquo;Horrors,&rdquo; and conducted his financial affairs.&nbsp; Borrow 
stayed on at Hereford Square until towards the end of 1874.&nbsp; A meeting
with C. G. Leland prompted him to issue his last book worth 
notice&mdash;&ldquo;The Romano-Y-Lavo-Lil&rdquo;; or Word Book of <!-- page
46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>the English 
Gypsy Language.&nbsp; This, in the light of the advance made in philology, 
and very notably in gypsy lore, proved conclusively that Borrow could now 
no longer be reckoned a &ldquo;deep &rsquo;Gyptian,&rdquo; though the 
impulse of his work undoubtedly stirred up many scholars to pursue the 
study of the Romany language.&nbsp; In his latter days in London he 
sometimes had pleasant intercourse with such kindred spirits as Mr. 
Watts-Dunton, Mr. Hindes Groome, and he was still robust enough at seventy 
to plunge into an ice-covered pond on a bitterly cold March morning.&nbsp; 
When he finally retired to his Oulton cottage, where a Mrs. Barbour was his
housekeeper until Dr. and Mrs. MacOubrey joined him in 1878, he began to 
spend much of his time in Norwich.&nbsp; A life-long friend of his was Miss
Lucy Brightwell, a prolific writer and most skilful etcher, who died at her
house, No. 3, Surrey Street, April 17th, 1875.&nbsp; Here we must perforce 
quote Dr. Knapp: &ldquo;Miss Brightwell was an intimate and constant 
visitor at the Willow Lane house from her early years.&nbsp; Old Mrs. 
Borrow mentions her in her letters as &lsquo;the child&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;Lucy,&rsquo; and the latter in her correspondence calls Mrs. Borrow 
&lsquo;mother.&rsquo; . . . It was in the garden of Miss Brightwell&rsquo;s
house in Surrey Street, Norwich, that the only <i>photograph</i> existing 
of Mr. Borrow was taken by her brother &lsquo;Tom&rsquo; in 1848.&nbsp; 
This picture is now so faded that it has defied all attempts to reproduce 
it in this book.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fact is that Dr. Knapp was refused the 
use of the photograph, which was not taken by Tom Brightwell, but by Mr. 
Pulley, a solicitor, of the firm of Field, Son, &amp; Pulley.&nbsp; This 
picture is now the property of Mrs. Simms Reeve, of Norwich and Brancaster 
Hall.&nbsp; Her own portrait as a girl is one of several separate figures 
framed together, Borrow occupying a place in the top row.&nbsp; 
Fortunately, by the courtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Simms Reeve, this interesting 
portrait of Borrow, when he was forty-five years of age, has now been 
reproduced, and it is, perhaps, the most valuable item in this souvenir, it
also is lent by Mrs. Simms Reeve for the temporary collection of Borrow 
relics in Norwich Castle Museum.&nbsp; When he came to Norwich in these 
later days Borrow used to lodge at Mrs. Church&rsquo;s, in Lady Lane, off 
Bethel Street, <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>known as Ivy House, and much frequented by theatrical people, now 
adapted to be a Dispensary.&nbsp; A grand-daughter of Borrow&rsquo;s friend
W. Bodham Donne wrote me, in 1902, that &ldquo;Borrow once lodged at Ivy 
Cottage, Lady&rsquo;s Lane, where a dear old Miss Donne was 
living.&rdquo;&nbsp; From Lady Lane it is only a few hundred yards to the 
well-loved little house in Willow Lane, at which his father died, and where
his mother lived till her removal to Oulton as stated above.</p>
<p>Little remains to record.&nbsp; Some there are who remember 
Borrow&rsquo;s tall figure in the streets of Norwich.&nbsp; The old 
city&mdash;&ldquo;the Norwich I love&rdquo;&mdash;seemed to draw him 
irresistibly from his hermitage.&nbsp; Nor is this to be wondered at; for 
all accounts I have seen, and heard also, of the Oulton domestic 
arrangements during the last few years of his life, agree that they were 
deplorable.&nbsp; Mr. Elwin told me that, after the death of Borrow&rsquo;s
wife, the home was not well looked after, and that Mr. Cooke 
(Murray&rsquo;s cousin and partner) &ldquo;told him with tears in his eyes 
how neglected the home was, and how the noble old man was broken 
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Jay also informed me that &ldquo;after Mrs. 
Borrow&rsquo;s death Mrs. MacOubrey was wanting in tact to manage him and 
the affairs of the family, hence the gradual decline of household matters 
into the disorder and neglect referred to by visitors to Oulton in 
Borrow&rsquo;s latter days.&rdquo;&nbsp; No wonder the weary old Lav-engro 
was glad to revisit the scenes of his youth, and found it restful to spend 
much of his time in the Norfolk Hotel (which stood where the Hippodrome now
is), talking with his friends, with a glass before him&mdash;&ldquo;of 
course to pay for the seat,&rdquo; remarks Dr. Knapp, with an apparent 
attempt at sarcasm.&nbsp; I know a gentleman in Norwich now who remembers 
Borrow&rsquo;s visits to the Subscription Library opposite the Guildhall, 
and his adjournments to the &ldquo;Norfolk&rdquo; after asking my informant
to join him in a glass of brandy and water.</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s death, July 26th, 1881, was very sudden.&nbsp; Left alone
in the house, he was found dead when Dr. and Mrs. MacOubrey returned from a
drive to Lowestoft.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems fitting,&rdquo; says Mr. Jenkins,
&ldquo;that he should die alone&rdquo;; but he justly adds, &ldquo;whatever
the facts, it was strange to leave so old and so infirm a man quite 
unattended.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Knapp affirms that Borrow &ldquo;had earnestly
requested <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
48</span>them not to go away, because he felt that he was in a dying 
state.&rdquo;&nbsp; The corpse of the worn-out veteran was detained in 
Oulton from July 26th to August 4th&mdash;&ldquo;by reason of the absence 
of a physician&rsquo;s certificate,&rdquo; says Dr. Knapp.&nbsp; Borrow was
buried in Brompton Cemetery beside his wife.</p>
<p>At the time of his death Borrow was practically forgotten, and even 
first-rate handbooks omitted his name from their obituaries.&nbsp; The case
is altered now, and the Borrow Celebration, of which this souvenir will be 
one memento, bears eloquent testimony to the fact.</p>
<p>Those who enter the Valley of Vision with George Borrow, those who come 
into touch with the glamour and witchery of him, will ever find a new light
in life, and travel in new avenues of happiness.&nbsp; The present 
Celebration will bring fresh fame to Norwich, and no doubt will give an 
immense impulse to Borrovian sentiment in his beloved city.&nbsp; We are 
never likely to have another Borrow!</p>
<h2>A FLOWER FROM BORROW&rsquo;S GRAVE.</h2>
<p>A simple flower with heart of gold,<br />
&nbsp;  What should&rsquo;st thou know of mortal sorrow?<br />
Though thou hadst grown in London mould,<br />
&nbsp;  Above the grave of mighty Borrow.</p>
<p>So firm the hold, thy creeping root,<br />
&nbsp;  So true thy purchase on the stone,<br />
Thou there defiest the city soot,<br />
&nbsp;  The careless step, the heat of noon.</p>
<p>An emblem fair of Lavengro,<br />
&nbsp;  Thou art in all thy brave upbringing;<br />
Obscure, he wandered to and fro,<br />
&nbsp;  Wrote joy on earth by faith upspringing.</p>
<p>Like thee he loved the windy heath;<br />
&nbsp;  He did not fear though storms might rave,<br />
He dreaded not the earth beneath,<br />
&nbsp;  He chose his own, a London grave.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
